          <h2>OUR MISSION</h2> 
     <p>We at Mindful by Nature believe that mindfulness is part of human nature. The way we live our lives in today's world has separated us from that innate ability to stay in that space of mindfulness and the busyness of everyday life in our fast-paced society distracts us from our mindful nature. The goal of Mindful by Nature is to help people find that space again by guiding  people in mindfulness techniques, assisting in self healing, and bringing people back to nature. With these skills it is our hope that people will see that they can have a more peaceful and fulfilling life by taking the time to respect and reconnect with themselves and with nature.<br></br>  
     We feel that there are many opportunities for our organization to help the local community around us and to help individuals on a personal level.  Mindful by Nature is located just outside of the Research Triangle in North Carolina which includes the major cities of Raleigh, Durham,and Chapel Hill.  This is one of the fastest growing areas in the nation and with the increase in population comes many stresses.  This gives us the opportunity to help people from these areas by taking them out of the oftentimes stressful city life and taking them to the beautiful natural landscapes of North Carolina. We look to the future with hopes to expand outside of the Research Triangle so that we can help to reconnect as many people as we can with themselves and the natural world around them.<br></br>
     We hope to accomplish our goal by working with various groups and organizations to spread the word of our company so that we can help larger groups of individuals find that mindful nature connection.  Our primary events to introduce people to Mindful by Nature will include team building exercises for large organizations looking to build morale and trust within their companies, educational field trips and presentations at local schools to spark children‚Äôs interest in science and nature while at the same time providing them with techniques to deal with the stresses that they face on a daily basis, and a grassroots movement in which we meet people at local markets and festivals and volunteer to help clean up and beautify local parks. These events will introduce people to who we are and what we are working toward. <br></br>
     We will give people various mindful techniques to quiet the mind so that they may reconnect with the world around them.  These techniques include but are not limited to guided meditation, walking meditation, sound healing and Reiki.</p>

          <p>I feel like I am just a regular guy.<br/><br/>
          I never had a guru, traveled to Coachella or Burning Man or found myself huddled in a corner after drinking Ayahuasca. (Geez, maybe I am missing out)
          <br/><br/>
          I just happened to learn the benefits of mindfulness, meditation and reiki healing from my own life experiences. I want to share that with the world and help those that are open and receptive to learning and healing themselves.
          <br/><br/>
          My background is in Environmental Science and Education and I have a life long love of the outdoors. I learned a lot about myself from my time in nature and learned many of the practices that I use today in that space. (I mean, it‚Äôs called Mindful by Nature, right üòÅ )
          <br/><br/>
          I have practiced mindfulness and meditation for nearly a decade and have received my Mindfulness Coaching Certification and am also a Reiki Master with plans to take the step to Reiki Master Teacher in the near future.
          <br/><br/>
          My calling is to help people heal themselves, plain and simple‚Ä¶.and sometimes it's complex
